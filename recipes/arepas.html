    <h2>How to prepair arepas</h2>
    <p>Arepas are a food of pre-Columbian origin; long before the arrival of the settlers, the date is not specifically known, the aborigines already consumed arepas. The name of the arepa and its origin is disputed with Colombia, but the same food is consumed throughout America with different names, for example, in Mexico they are known as "Gorditas".</p>
    <h1>ingredients</h1>
    <h2>for the arepas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of precooked cornmeal</li>
        <li>2½ cups warm water</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>For the filling (Perico Eggs)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li> ¼ cup diced tomato</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cucharadas de aceite</li>
            <li>a pinch of salt</li> 
        </ul>
    <h1>Preparation</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread the oil in a large skillet and place it on the stove over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Place the water and a pinch of salt in a bowl; Gradually add the flour and stir with a spoon. Wait about three minutes until the dough takes a bit of consistency. Then knead it vigorously until it doesn't stick to the edges of the container. There should be no lumps.</li>
            <li>Form spheres the size of an orange and then flatten them with the palms of your hands until you get circular arepas about four inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Place them in the pan and cook with a lid for about 5 minutes; uncover and return to the arepas. If you want very crispy arepas, you can put them in the oven for about 10 minutes over medium heat at 180 °C. The arepas will puff out slightly and if tapped gently they will make a hollow sound.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>For the filling:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a skillet over medium high heat, place the oil and sauté the onion, then add the tomato and stir for about five more minutes. Add a pinch of salt and the beaten eggs.</li>
            <li>Cook covered for three minutes and then stir, removing the parakeet from the edges. Take off the heat.</li>
            <li>Open the arepas with a sharp knife on the side and fill one with beans, another with shredded meat and finally the perico eggs.</li>

        </ol>
